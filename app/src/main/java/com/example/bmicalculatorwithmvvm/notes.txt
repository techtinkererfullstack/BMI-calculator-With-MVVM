- fragment is lighter than activity
- android recommend only 1 activity
- space utilize
- page navigation
- code reuse
- fragment can be attached to any activity
- navigation meaning each screen switch
- destination mean each screen

# what is fragment
    -represents a behavior or portion of the UI in an activity ("microactivity"
    -must be hosted in an activity
    -lyfecycle tied to host activity's lifecycle
    -can be added or removed at runtime

# fragment lifecycle diagram
    Fragment is added -> onAttach() -> onCreate() -> onViewCreated() -> OnStart() - onResume() ->
    Fragment is Active ->onPause()-> onStop()->onDestryView()->onDestroy()->onDetach()->Fragment is Destroyed

# Summary of fragment states
    Initialized - onAttach() - fragment is attached to host
    Created - onCreate(),onCreateView(),onViewCreated() - Fragment is created and layout is being initialized
    Started - onStart() - Fragment is started and visible
    Resumed - onResume() - Fragment has input focus
    Paused - onPause() - Fragment no longer has input focus
    stopped - onStop() - Fragment is not visible
    Destryed - onDestroyView(), onDestroy(), onDetach() - fragment is removed from host

# navigation component
    -navigation component is a collection of libraries a tooling, including an integrated editor, for creating navigation paths through an app
    -assumes one Activity per graph with many Fragment destinations
    -consist of three major parts:
        -- Navigation Graph
        -- Navigation Host (NavHost)
        -- Navigation Controller (NavController)

# Add Dependency in build.gradle
dependency:
implementation "androidx.navigation:navigation-fragment-ktx:$nav_version"
implementation "androidx.navigation:navigation-ui-ktx:$nav_version"

main activity will host all navigation fragment
#<fragment
    android:id="@+id/nav_host"
    android:name="androidx.navigation.fragment.NavHostFragment"
    app:defaultNavHost="true"
    app:navGraph="@navigation/nav_graph_name"/>

New resource type located in res/navigation directory
-XML file containing all of your navigation destinations and actions
-Lists all the (Fragment/Activity) destinations that can be navigated to
-lists the associated actions to traverse between them
-optionally lists animations for entering or exiting


#Data binding library
-remove broiler plate code of find vew by id manually
- there have other useful functionality of viewbinding library other than this

#Model View ViewModel
-preferred architectural pattern for android
-serrates ui from business logic
-Life-cycle aware - saves states during configuration change

ACTIVITY -> VIEW MODEL (Live Datas) -> REPOSITORY -> MODEL(ROOM)/REMOTE DATE SOURCE(RETROFIT) -> sqlite/web server
   1                2                        3
 View          ViewModel                   Model

2. VIEW MODEL
    -prepare data for the ui
    -must not reference activity, fragment, or views in view hierarchy
    -scoped to a lifecycle (which activity and fragment have)
    -enables data to survive configuration changes
    -survives as long as the scope is alive
    ** when activity destroyed then view model scope is cleared otherwise always stays active
